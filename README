This is the README file for Metl, a generic parsing-expression-grammar
(PEG) system for OCaml.  

Copyright 2012 Daniel S. Bensen

Metl is loosely based on Allesandro Warth's OMeta pattern-matching 
language.  See manual.html for details.

There's no configure script yet, so the only way to configure Metl
currently is to manually edit the path to the lib directory in 
Makefile.  Then you can run "make metl".

The distribution also currently contains a working example of
Metl rules, called Minml.  You can build Minml by editing the lib
path in Minml/_tags and running "make minml".

Please contact Dan at danbensen@att.net for any bug reports,
feature requests, and other related comments you might have.
