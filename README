This is the README file for Metl, a generic parsing-expression-grammar
(PEG) system for OCaml.  

Copyright 2012 Daniel S. Bensen

Metl is loosely based on Allesandro Warth's OMeta pattern-matching 
language.  See manual.html for details.

There's no configure script yet, so the only way to build Metl
currently is to manually edit the path to the lib directory in 
Makefile, Metl/_tags, and Minml/_tags.  Then you can run "make all".

Please contact Dan at danbensen@att.net for any bug reports,
feature requests, and other related comments you might have.
