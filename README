This is the README file for Metl, a generic PEG system for OCaml.
Metl is loosely based on OMeta, 

To see what Metl can do, set $(LIB) in Makefile and edit */_tags
accordingly, and run "make all".

As of June 2012, Metl is still in "toy" status.
Please contact Dan Bensen (danbensen@att.net) for bug reports,
feature requests, and other related comments.
